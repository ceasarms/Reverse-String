Second type "reverse= hw002(str)"
# Q1
An algorithm is defined as a methodoligical and logical procedure that gurantees solving a particular problem. A heuristic in programming is defined as a technique designed to solve a problem more efficiently. To solve a rubiks cube an algorithm is needed to solve it. A heuristic example could be someones ability to make an educated guess as it is an efficient way to come to a solution but not always completely accurate.
# Q2
Using only agorithms is beneficial because it uses a definite procedure to correctly solve a problem. However, it poises as a disadvantage when there are large tasks to do as algorithms are lenthy and sometimes complex. The largere the task the more complex and long an algorithm is which isnt necessarily beneficial
